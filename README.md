# Minecraft-Hotkeys
 
A basic AutoHotKey script for automating fishing and mob/XP grinding in Minecraft  
Original concept stolen from [monpjc/XAHK](https://github.com/monpjc/XAHK)

## Instructions

When you open the script, a GUI should appear with instructions on how to use it  
Note: If alt-tabbing out of Minecraft opens the pause menu, press F3+P (or fn+F3+P on some laptops)
