A basic [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script for automating fishing and mob/XP grinding in Minecraft  
Original concept (and a few button timings) stolen from [monpjc/XAHK](https://github.com/monpjc/XAHK)

## Instructions

When you open the script, the following GUI should appear

## Features

- AFK Fishing
- AFK Mob grinder
- AFK Cobblestone generator
- Quick concrete
- Quick takeoff
- Autoclick either the left or right mouse buttons

The ones listed as AFK work even after alt-tabbing out of Minecraft, assuming you used F3+P to disable automatic pausing when the game loses focus
